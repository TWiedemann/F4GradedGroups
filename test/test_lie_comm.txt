### Test executed with ConicAlg_rank, ComRing_rank >= 2, Trace_MaxLength >= 4

### This file tests that the F4-commutator relations in the Lie algebra have the
### desired form and that the claimed Chevalley-type bases (for F4 and G2) adheres
### indeed Chevalley-type bases.
### Runtime: ~4 minutes.

true

## Test that the Chevalley-type bases (for F4 and G2) satisfy the axioms of Chevalley-type bases

# Test that x_a*x_{-a}=h_a and that this element acts as CartanInt(a,b) on L_b for all roots b
# (and not merely for those with pi(b)_1 <> 0).
gap> TestChevH();
true

# Test that c(a,b) = -c(a,b) for all roots a, b for which a+b is also a root
